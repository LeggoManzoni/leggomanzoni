As it approached, she descended from the sedan chair, waved to the coachman to stop, and went up to Nibbio, who had poked his head out the window, and whispered the master’s orders to him. </note>

The old woman leaned her chin against the door, staring at Lucia, and said, “Come along, girl. Come, you poor child. Come with me, I’ve got orders to treat you well and to cheer you up.” </note>

Although the strange wild place and the close watch of her guards offered her no hope of rescue, she opened her mouth to scream. But before she could make a sound, Nibbio threatened her with the gag again, so she suppressed her cry, trembling. After a brief struggle, they grabbed her and forced her into the sedan chair. </note>

The words filled the wretch’s mind with a strange, slow confusion, like the memory of light in an old man blinded since childhood. </note>

He saw the sedan chair moving very slowly behind the carriage, and in front, at a distance that grew with each passing moment, Nibbio running uphill. </note>

There was no one around, and though she let out a single cry, no one appeared. The coachman was ready, the horses were in excellent shape, and there was no one on the road but…” </note>

The shock and confusion that would spread throughout the castle the next day, everything upside down, as he remained powerless, speechless, his body tossed who knows where. </note>

If he were to have these thoughts in broad daylight before a crowd, he might not hesitate to jump in a river and disappear. </note>

What if it’s an invention of the priests? What should I do then? Why should I die? What does it matter what I’ve done? </note>

As he regained his composure, he removed his hands from his temples and thought about the person who had said these words. She was no longer his prisoner, or a supplicant, but his guide, dispensing grace and consolation. </note>

But then a dim hope revived that this was just a temporary delirium, and his old spirit and desires would return. One moment, he dreaded the day, for his people would see how low he had fallen. In the next, he longed for it, in the hope that it would also shed light on his tumultuous thoughts. </note>

The sky was overcast beneath a single ashen cloud. As daylight slowly spread, however, he spotted people walking on a road at the other end of the valley, joined by others coming out of their houses, all heading in the same direction, toward the pass on the right of the castle, dressed in their Sunday best and moving with remarkable enthusiasm. </note>
