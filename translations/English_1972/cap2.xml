But Don Abbondio knew nothing yet except that the following day would be a day of battle, and much of his night was spent in painful deliberation. </note>

Far from proposing to infringe such a commandment, he regretted having mentioned the matter even to Perpetua. </note>

If I can keep the lad at bay for that short time, he thought, I shall have another two months’ breathing space; and a lot can happen in two months. </note>

And his many years of experience would give him every advantage over an ignorant boy. After all, he said to himself, Renzo’s mind is on his sweetheart, but mine is on my own skin; so I have more at stake, apart from having more brains. </note>

Next he got up and waited for the young man to arrive, with mingled fear and impatience. </note>

In earlier years it had been a fairly lucrative calling, and though it had fallen off a skilful worker could still make an honest living out of it. </note>
