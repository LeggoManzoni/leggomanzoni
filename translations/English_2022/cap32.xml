        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n2" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10028" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10175">On the twenty-second, two of its members were sent to the army camp below Casale to report the straits and troubles of the city: the enormous expenses, the empty coffers, the future years’ revenue already committed, and the current taxes unpaid, due to the widespread misery whose many causes included, primarily, the squandering of resources on the army. They were to request that the Royal Treasury bear the costs of the plague, as mandated by law and unbroken custom, and by special decree of Emperor Charles V. During the plague of 1576, the Governor of Milan, the Marquis of Ayamonte, had not only suspended all government taxes, but he had also given the city a subsidy of forty thousand scudi from the treasury. The Council requested four things in particular: the suspension of taxes, as per the previous outbreak; financing from the treasury; a dispatch from the Governor to the King detailing the misery in the city and in the province; and a halt to any new military garrisons, since the area was already devastated by the existing ones. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n3" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10176" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10224">In response, the Governor sent his condolences along with words of encouragement: He regretted that he could not be in the city to help with the relief effort, but hoped, nonetheless, that the zeal of the council would compensate for everything, because now was the time to spend unstintingly, and to make every possible effort. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n6" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10257" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10294">Grand Chancellor Ferrer responded that the council had read the Governor’s missive con gran desconsuelo—with heavy hearts. Other delegations went back and forth, with more questions and answers, but I have found no evidence that less ambiguous conclusions were reached. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n7" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10295" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10404">Some time later, at the height of the plague, the Governor sent an official letter to Ferrer, deputizing him to take charge of the outbreak, since he himself, as he wrote, was too occupied with the war: a war that, by the way, after at least one million people had died from the plague (not counting the soldiers), throughout northern Italy, from Lombardy to the Venetian territories, Piedmont, Tuscany, and part of Romagna; and after the taking and barbaric sack of Mantua, had ended with everyone recognizing Nevers as the new Duke of Mantua, when the whole purpose of the war had been to keep him out of Italy. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n8" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10405" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10473">Nevers was obliged, however, to cede to the Duke of Savoy a part of Montferrat (which provided a measly income of fifteen thousand scudi), and to the Duke of Guastalla, Ferrante, other lands (for an income of six thousand scudi); not to mention a separate confidential pact, by which the Duke of Savoy ceded Pinerolo to France, in a treaty that was executed sometime later, under other pretexts, and through deception. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n9" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10474" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10503">The Decurioni also adopted another resolution: to ask the Cardinal-Archbishop for a solemn procession through the city of the body of San Carlo, who had administered heroically to the needs of the people during the previous plague. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n10" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10504" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10510">The good prelate refused, for several reasons. </note>

And if they did not, the congregation of so many people would only serve to further spread the epidemic: a much more real danger (“Si unguenta scelerata et unctores in urbe essent…Si non essent…Certiusque adeo malum” [Ripamonti, 185]). </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n13" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10640" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10655">Because in the meantime, the underlying suspicion of unguents had been revived and was raging more widely and furiously than before. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n15" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10676" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10702">The news of these discoveries flew from mouth to mouth, and hearing about them had the same effect as seeing them, as often happens in times of high anxiety. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n16" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10703" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10787">People willingly embraced these rumors as they became more distressed by the disease’s presence, and irritated by its stubborn threat. For anger is quick to punish, and as a wise man accurately observed, it would rather blame troubles on human misconduct, against which it can exact revenge, than recognize a cause against which it can only resign itself. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n17" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10788" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10811">A refined poison, instantaneous and highly penetrating: These words were used to explain the virulence of the disease, as well as its most obscure and disordered symptoms. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n20" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10864" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10899">If no symptoms appeared immediately after the first sighting of the unguents, the reason was clear: Amateur poisoners must have failed in their first attempt. But now the art had been perfected, and the perpetrators were hell-bent on carrying out their plan. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n21" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10900" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10947">Anyone who had argued that it was a prank, or denied the existence of a plot, was dismissed as blind or obstinate, or even suspected of trying to conceal the truth from the public, namely, that he himself was an accomplice, an anointer. That word soon became common, solemn, tremendous. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap32-n22" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10948" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10971">The fervent belief in anointers made their discovery inevitable: All eyes were alert, any act could prove suspicious. </note>

They grabbed him by his white hair, and pummeled him with their fists and feet. They pushed and pulled him outside, and if they didn’t finish him off there, it was only so they could haul him, half-dead, to the prison, to the judges, to the torture chambers. “I saw him while they were dragging him out like that,” writes Ripamonti, “and I did not hear another word about what happened to him. I am quite sure he could not have survived more than a few more minutes.” </note>

He gestured to someone else, and others arrived on the scene. A crowd gathered to watch and keep an eye on them, since their clothing, hairstyles, and shoulder bags gave them away as foreigners, and what’s worse, as Frenchmen. </note>

At the cry of “anointers,” at the shout of a child, the drumbeat began and people came running. The hapless soul was either pelted with stones, or grabbed and hauled off to prison by the mob. </note>

This was as much wisdom as one man could muster against the forces of his times and the insistence of the majority, against public opinion, with its confused idea of danger, contradicted and unsupported by the evidence we know today.

The rich had laid out their most precious belongings. The façades of the more humble homes had been decorated by their wealthier neighbors or at public expense.

At each intersection, or rather little piazza—which in those days were called carrobi (only one remains today)—where the main roads fed into the neighborhoods, the procession would come to a stop, and they’d lay the casket at the foot of a cross. San Carlo had ordered these crosses—some of which are still standing today—placed at each intersection during the previous plague. </note>

Lo and behold, while many believed confidently and with fanatical certainty that the procession would end the plague, the death toll went up the next day, in every social class and in every part of the city. It rose so suddenly and so steeply that no one could mistake the cause, or the occasion, for anything other than the procession itself. </note>

So to explain this turn of events, they had to fall back on the other venerable myth of poisonous malignant powders that the scientific community of Europe believed in those days. Rumor had it that these powders had been sprinkled along the streets and especially at the places where the procession stopped, thus sticking to the hems of clothing and to the bare feet of those who had walked in the crowd that day. </note>

And it is hard for all or many to continue believing that something strange is being done without someone coming forward who believes he has done it. </note>

Mortales parat morbos, miranda videntur—Prepare for deadly diseases, wondrous things will be seen.” This prediction, taken, they said, from a book titled Specchio degli almanacchi perfetti, published in Turin in 1623, was on everyone’s lips. </note>

I am referring in particular to Tadino, who had warned of it, seen it arrive, and kept his eye, so to speak, on its progress. He had said and preached that it was the plague, that it was spread through human contact, and that the whole country would be infected unless protective measures were taken. But now, he, too, began to derive conclusive proof of poisonous, harmful unguents from these same symptoms. This is the same man who had remarked that delirium was a side effect of the disease after the second person in Milan, Carlo Colonna, died of the plague. It was shocking to see him cite the following incidents as proof of unguents and a diabolic plot: Two witnesses gave a deposition that people had come into their sick friend’s room one night to show him the cure and offer him money if he was willing to anoint the houses in his neighborhood. When he refused, they vanished, and in their place was a wolf under the bed and three big cats on top, “which would remain there until daybreak” (123–124). </note>
