                                    <strong>June 13, 2025</strong>. At the AIUCD 2025 conference (Associazione per
                                    l'Informatica Umanistica e la Cultura Digitale), the <i>Leggo Manzoni</i> project
                                    was presented through the paper "<i>TEI Encoding as a Unified Structure for
                                        Multilingual Digital Editions: The LeggoManzoni Case Study</i>". The
                                    presentation, delivered by Mariia Levchenko (Università "Alma Mater" di Bologna),
                                    Beatrice Nava (Universität Wien), and Ersilia Russo (Università degli Studi di
                                    Firenze), illustrated the innovative methodological approach developed for creating

                                    The paper demonstrated how TEI encoding can serve as a unified framework for
                                    managing multiple translations and versions of literary works within a single
                                    digital environment. Using <i>The Betrothed</i> as a case study, the presentation
                                    showcased the technical solutions implemented in the <i>Leggo Manzoni</i> platform
                                    to align and correlate texts across different languages while maintaining scholarly
                                    precision and accessibility for both researchers and students.

                                    first was <a href="https://pkudh.org/project/sqj/">Shī Qiān Jiā</a>, an AI-powered
                                    platform capable of generating Chinese
                                    classical poetry. By entering just a few keywords, users can produce refined verses
                                    based on centuries of literary tradition. The second project introduced was
                                    the <a href="https://pkudh.org/project/rarebib/">National Rare Book Catalog
                                        System</a>, developed in collaboration with the National
                                    Library of China. It offers interactive interfaces, semantic visualizations, and
                                    mapping tools to explore the transmission and distribution of ancient texts.

                                    presented as a robust platform for reading,
                                    annotating, and studying classical texts, featuring advanced tools such as character
                                    recognition, automated punctuation, and access to digitized materials. Finally, the
                                    session concluded with <a href="https://pkudh.org/project/gc/">Guanchao</a>, a
                                    project that brings Song-dynasty textual
                                    descriptions to life. Using generative AI, it transforms literary passages into
                                    animated scenes and visual representations inspired by traditional Chinese painting,
                                    offering a completely new way to "see" the past.

                                <p>The encounter fostered a valuable exchange on two levels — literature and Digital
                                    Humanities — opening up new perspectives for research and future collaboration.

                                    The highlight was the hands-on XML/TEI markup workshop, in which the Chinese
                                    students learned to encode Zhang Shihua's 1998 translation of the novel into
                                    Chinese. This peer-to-peer learning experience showcased the platform's
                                    segment-level alignment technology, enabling precise correlation between the
                                    original Italian text and the Chinese translation segments. Students practiced TEI

                                    module. This module is part of a broader international collaboration between the
