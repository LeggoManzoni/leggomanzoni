In such circumstances people who meet each other for the first time behave as if they were old acquaintances. Every time the cart overtook a pedestrian, there was an exchange of questions and answers. </note>

He began to worry about the size of the crowd that seemed to be going their way, and still more about the larger throng that he heard was coming from the other end of the valley. </note>

He watched at them out of the corner of his eye. These were not, in fact, the same faces that he had seen during that agonizing previous journey to the castle – or if there were one or two of the same men, they had changed a great deal in appearance – but the sight of them distressed him more than we can say. </note>

The vines were stripped, not as they normally are in time of harvest, but as if hailstorms and whirlwinds had passed that way together. The stems of the vines were lying on the ground, leafless and tangled; the supports had been pulled up and the ground trampled and strewn with splinters, leaves, and shoots; fruit trees were split or reduced to stumps. Gaps were torn in the hedges, and gates had been carried away. </note>

The air was heavy and unpleasant, and wafts of a stronger stench came out of the houses. Some of the villagers were busy clearing the filth out of their homes, or repairing their shutters as best they could, while others stood in groups lamenting their fate. As the coach passed through, outstretched hands appeared at the windows, begging for alms. </note>

They arrived, and it was as they had feared. </note>

She began to sweep out, and to gather together and set in order the few things the soldiers had left her. Then she sent for a carpenter and a smith, to repair the more serious damage to the cottage. Finally she looked over her new set of linen, piece by piece, and counted her new set of coins. ‘I’ve fallen on my feet,’ she said to herself. ‘Thanks be to God and the Madonna and to that kind gentleman, I can really say that I’ve fallen on my feet.’ </note>

With every step they took along the passage, they became more Conscious of an odour, a poisonous smell, a pestilential stink, which almost seemed to push them back again. Holding their noses, they made their way to the kitchen door, and went in on tiptoe, placing their feet with care to avoid the filth which covered the floor. They looked around. </note>

There were down and wing-feathers from Perpetua’s hens, torn linen, leaves from Don Abbondio’s calendars, bits of broken pots and plates; some heaped up and some scattered around. </note>

Efforts had been made, by the addition of birettas, tonsures and starched bands, to make them look like priests. Care had also been taken to make them repulsive and laughable – an object in which such artists could hardly fail. </note>

Don Abbondio accused Perpetua of not hiding the things properly; and the reader can imagine whether she took the criticism in silence. When they had had a good shout, both standing there with arms outstretched, each with one forefinger pointing towards the hole, they grumbled their way back to the house. </note>

For many, many days they had to camp out, as it were, in their own home, settling in as best they could, which was not very well, while doors, furniture and household utensils were slowly replaced with the help of money borrowed from Agnese. </note>

By inquiry and questioning, by spying and sniffing out, Perpetua discovered that some of her master’s valuables had not been destroyed or carried off by the soldiers, as they had supposed, but were safe and sound in the houses of certain of the villagers. She pressed her master to assert himself, and demand the return of his property. </note>

So he lived in fear of finding one of them, or perhaps a group, beating on his door – which had been the first thing that he had had mended, in great haste, and which he kept locked, with much care. But by the mercy of Heaven that never happened. </note>
