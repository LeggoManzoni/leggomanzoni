                        <p><i>Leggo Manzoni. Quaranta commenti alla Quarantana</i> makes available, in a freely consultable web environment, the 1840-42 edition of the 
                            <i>Promessi sposi (The Betrothed)</i> accompanied by images and forty critical commentaries to allow an ‘immersive’ reading of the novel, 
                            with the guidance of the main scholars of Manzoni's work.</p>

                            <p>Leggo Manzoni is not only a scientific project, but also a shared workshop between the University and High Schools. The project has developed thanks to the active participation of
                                 <a href="./credits#scuole">20 secondary schools</a> 
                                 throughout Italy in two PCTO (Percorso per le Competenze Trasversali e l'Orientamento) cycles: 
                            “Adopt a commentary on the <i> Promessi Sposi”</i>, organized by <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/paola.italia" target="_blank">Paola Italia</a>

                            The initiative is dedicated to developing textual and digital skills, teaching students 
                            how to recognise authoritative sources and texts on the web, and to introducing them to the basics 
                            of digital philology. In 30 hours of lessons, carried out in presence and online, 
                            guided by University tutors Beatrice Nava and Ersilia Russo, 
                            more than <a href="./credits#insegnanti">30 teachers and 500 students</a> 
                            contributed to the digitisation and XML/TEI encoding of critical comments on <i>The Betrothed</i>.
                            The project then continued with the collaboration of two students from the University of Bologna's

                                of the editorial project. This allows an ‘immersive’ reading of the work as envisioned by Manzoni,
