Each time that the cart overtook a pedestrian there was an exchange of questions and replies. </note>

He glanced at them out of the corner of his eye. There were none of those faces which he had seen upon his former painful journey, or if there were any such among them, they were very much changed; but spite of all this, it is impossible to describe the annoyance this sight caused him. "Oh, unfortunate that I am!" thought he; only see what follies they are committing! </note>

Oh, alas, for me! In such vexatious circumstances as these, when one would wish to conceal oneself under the earth, this man does all that lies in his power to make himself observed, to exhibit himself. It seems as though he really wished to invite them!" </note>

Here the cart stopped; they descended, Don Abbondio paid the driver in haste, dismissed him, and commenced the ascent with his two companions without saying a single word. </note>

Vineyards despoiled, not by the vintage, but as by a hurricane; the vines trampled under foot and broken; the props torn up; the earth trodden on and strewn with chips, leaves, and young suckers; the trees felled, or their branches lopped off; the hedges broken through; the stiles carried away. </note>

The inhabitants were already occupied, some in clearing away the filth, others in repairing their doors in the best way they could; whilst some, their arms crossed upon their breasts, lamented in concert. As the travellers drove along, hands were extended from all sides into the carriage to implore alms. </note>

She sent for a carpenter and locksmith to repair the most serious damage; and then unpacking the linen which the Unknown had given her, and counting in secret her scudi, she exclaimed to herself, "I have fallen on my feet. Thanks be to God, the Madonna, and this good Signor, I can indeed say I have fallen on my feet!" Don Abbondio and Perpetua entered their abode without the aid of keys. </note>

However, holding their noses, they approached the kitchen; they entered it on tip-toe; they looked around; nothing was entire; but in every corner they saw remains and fragments of what had been; feathers of Perpetua's fowls, rags of linen, leaves of Don Abbondio's almanacks, pieces of pots and pans, all lay strewn about. </note>

For a long time were they obliged to live like people in a camp, managing as well as they could, and renewing by degrees the doors, the furniture, and the household utensils, with money lent by Agnese. </note>

Perpetua, by force of much questioning and research, succeeded in assuring herself that some of her master's furniture, which they had imagined fallen a prey to the soldiers, was, on the contrary, safe and sound in some of the peasants' houses; and she tormented her master that he should make his claims heard, and demand his own. </note>

But by the grace of heaven, this misfortune did not happen. </note>
