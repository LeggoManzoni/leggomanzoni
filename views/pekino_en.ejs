                                    from the English version. The first proper translation is therefore that of Zhang

                                    Roberta Priore, representing the University of Bologna, presented the work of the department laboratory,

                                    digitization of sources, using the example of the <a

                                <p>The comparison continued with the presentation of the hosts' work,
                                    with four projects that demonstrate the ability to integrate the history of
                                    tradition and digital innovations. The first is <a
                                        href="https://pkudh.org/project/sqj/">Shī Qiān Jiā</a>, a platform
                                    powered by artificial intelligence capable of generating classical Chinese poetry.
                                    Just enter a few words to see verses come to life, modeled on centuries of
                                    ancient literature. Continuing, the second project presented was the one
                                    dedicated to the <a href="https://pkudh.org/project/rarebib/">National Rare Books
                                        System</a>, a project born in collaboration with the Chinese National
                                    Library. Here you can explore an imposing library heritage through interactive
                                    interfaces, semantic visualizations and maps that tell the story of the
                                    transmission of ancient texts.

                                    was
                                    presented as a powerful tool for reading, annotating and studying
                                    classical texts, with advanced features such as character recognition,
                                    automatic punctuation and access to digitized texts. Finally, the comparison
                                    concluded with <a href="https://pkudh.org/project/gc/">Guanchao</a>, a project that
                                    gives life and form to textual descriptions of the Song dynasty. Through
                                    the use of generative artificial intelligence, texts are transformed into animated
                                    scenes and visualizations inspired by traditional pictorial art, allowing to
                                    "see" the past in a completely new way.

                                <p>The meeting allowed for comparison on a dual level, that of literature and
                                    that of Digital Humanities, stimulating new perspectives for research and
                                    collaboration.

                                    <strong>March 20, 2025. The LeggoManzoni workshop at Peking University.</strong>.
                                    On March 20, the University of Bologna Team held
                                    an innovative workshop at Peking University, presenting to
                                    Chinese students the methods of Digital Humanities through various projects related to
                                    Manzoni's <i>The Betrothed</i>. The session included two presentations: the
                                    first, led by Prof. Paola Italia, concerned the evolution of the novel from
                                    <i>Fermo e
                                        Lucia</i> to <i>The Betrothed</i>, in the two editions of 1827 and 1840
                                    (viewable in
                                    <a href="http://projects.dharc.unibo.it/philoeditor/">Philoeditor</a>).
                                    Subsequently, Maria Levchenko presented the
                                    <i>Multilingual Digital Edition</i> model and the pipeline of the
                                    <strong>LeggoManzoni</strong> platform,

                                    Particular interest was aroused by the practical XML/TEI markup workshop, in which
                                    Chinese students learned to encode the Chinese translation of the novel from
                                    1998 by Zhang Shihua. This <i>peer-to-peer</i> learning experience showed
                                    the platform's segment-level alignment technology, enabling precise
                                    correlation between the original Italian text and segments of the Chinese
                                    translation. Students had the opportunity to put TEI encoding principles into practice, contributing to the expansion of the TRANSLATE MANZONI module. This module
                                    is part of a broader international collaboration between the universities of Bologna
                                    and Beijing aimed at making Italian literature more accessible through
                                    innovative digital tools.

                                    The exhibition presents the life and works of Manzoni and translations of the novel, with an
                                    in-depth look at Chinese translations, created specifically for the Beijing
                                    exhibition. For the inauguration, a real Exhibition of Chinese
                                    translations and "pirate" copies of <i>The Betrothed</i> was also set up, which visitors were able to
                                    admire during the guided tour. The novel, in fact, had enormous success,
                                    documented by the large number of editions and translations, some also illustrated.
