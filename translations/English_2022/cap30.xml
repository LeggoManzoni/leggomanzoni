Any person you meet in such circumstances seems like an old acquaintance. Every time the cart pulled alongside a pedestrian, questions and answers were exchanged. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap30-n2" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap30.xml#c30_10070" targetEnd="quarantana/cap30.xml#c30_10101">Some, like our protagonists, had fled without waiting for the soldiers to arrive. Some had heard their trumpets and drums. And some had seen them, depicting them as the terrified are wont to depict. </note>

Indeed, that confluence of people, especially the greater numbers he could hear arriving from the opposite end of the valley, was making him wary. </note>

He glanced at them out of the corner of his eye; these didn’t look like the same faces he had seen on his previous stressful trip, or if some were, they had changed considerably. Nonetheless, he was distressed beyond words by the sight. </note>

She sent for a carpenter and a blacksmith to repair the worst of the damages, and then, inspecting her new linens piece by piece, and counting the new coins, she said to herself, “I’ve landed on my feet. Blessed be the Lord and the Madonna and that kind gentleman. </note>

Holding their noses, they headed toward the kitchen doorway. Entering on tiptoe, they examined the floor to see where they could set their feet down, avoiding as best they could the filth that covered it. They took a long look around. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap30-n139" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap30.xml#c30_13428" targetEnd="quarantana/cap30.xml#c30_13475">Nothing had been left in one piece. In every corner of that room and the rest of the house, all they could see were bits and pieces of things that used to be: quills and feathers from Perpetua’s hens, strips of bed linen, paper torn from Don Abbondio’s calendars, shards of broken pots and plates, all in heaps or strewn around the room. </note>

And with these same bits of charcoal, the looters, for fun, had scribbled stick figures on the wall, trying—by adding birettas or tonsures and wide bands—to make them look like priests, taking great pains to make them horrible and ridiculous: a goal, to tell the truth, that was easy to achieve for such artists. </note>

Don Abbondio started to blame Perpetua for not burying his valuables properly. And do you think she held back? After shouting at each other long and loud, each with an arm outstretched and a finger pointing at the hole, they went back in the house together, grumbling. </note>

I have no idea how long they had to camp there, settling in for better or worse, and replacing, little by little, doors, furniture, and utensils with money lent by Agnese. </note>

Perpetua, by dint of inquiring and questioning, snooping and sniffing around, had come to find out that some of her master’s household goods, which they had thought the soldiers looted or destroyed, were instead safe and sound in the homes of their fellow villagers. She nagged her master to go after them, and retrieve what belonged to him. </note>

Thank heavens, this never happened. </note>
