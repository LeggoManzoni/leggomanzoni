        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n2" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10028" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10175">And on the twenty-second two of their number were sent off to his field headquarters, to lay before him an account of the miserable and straitened circumstances of the city – enormous expenditure, empty coffers, the income of future years mortgaged, taxes for the current period unpaid because of the general poverty, to which many causes contributed, but most of all the damage done by the soldiers. They reminded him that expenditure arising from the plague ought to be met from Crown funds, according to old customs and laws which had never been abrogated, and also according to a special decree of Charles V. They mentioned that during the pestilence of 1576 the Governor, who was then the Marquis of Ayamonte, had not only waived all the taxes payable to the State, but had given the city a subvention of forty thousand scudi from State funds. Finally they made four requests: That the taxes should be waived, as on the previous occasion. That the State should make a subvention, as before. That the Governor should inform the King of the miseries of the city and of the whole province. That the Governor should grant exemption from any further billeting to the countryside which had already been devastated by the passage of the troops. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n3" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10176" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10224">The Governor wrote a reply full of condolences and fresh exhortations. He said that he was sorry not to be able to stay in the city and devote all his energies to the relief of its troubles, but hoped that the zeal of the decurions would be enough to provide for everything. This, he said, was a time to spend freely, to use every resource to the full. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n4" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10225" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10256">As for their specific requests, ‘proveeré en el mejor modo que el tiempo y necesidades presentes permitieren’.1 Under these words came a hieroglyph, as clear as his promises, which evidently stood for ‘Ambrogio Spinola’. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n5" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10257" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10294">The Great Chancellor, Antonio Ferrer wrote to tell him that this answer had been read by the decurions ‘con gran desconsuelo’.2 There were further comings and goings, requests and answers; but I cannot trace that any definite conclusions came of them. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n7" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10322" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10404">That war, we may note, caused the death from pestilence, quite apart from military casualties, of at least one million people in the territories of Lombardy, Venice, Piedmont, Tuscany and a part of Romagna; it made a desert of the places through which the troops passed, let alone those where they fought; it culminated in the capture and the horrifying sack of Mantua; and the upshot of it all was that everybody recognized the new Duke of Mantua, to exclude whom the war had been undertaken in the first place. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n8" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10405" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10473">But it must be added that he was obliged to cede a part of Montferrat, with revenues of fifteen thousand scudi,3 to the Duke of Savoy, and a certain other piece of territory, with revenues of six thousand scudi,3 to Duke Ferrante of Guastalla; and that there was also a very secret separate treaty, whereby the Duke of Savoy ceded Pinerolo to the French. This last agreement was carried out a little later, under other pretexts, with every kind of chicanery. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n10" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10504" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10510">The good prelate refused for many reasons. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n12" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10656" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10675">People had again seen – or imagined, perhaps, this time – patches of unguent on walls, on the gates of public buildings, on the doors of private houses, and on door-knockers. </note>

As often happens when people are very anxious, they were as impressed by what they had heard as if they had seen it. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n14" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10703" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10787">Embittered by the presence of disaster, excited by the immediacy of their danger, they were all the more willing to embrace that pernicious belief; for angry men always wish to inflict punishment. And a man of genius7 has acutely observed on this very point that they prefer to blame disasters on to human wickedness, against which revenge is possible, rather than to attribute them to a factor which can only be met with resignation. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap32-n19" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10900" targetEnd="quarantana/cap32.xml#c32_10947">Anyone who might still have maintained that the thing had been a joke, or might have denied the existence of a plot, was regarded as obstinately blind to the facts – if indeed he did not fall under suspicion of being a man with an interest in diverting public attention from the truth, of being an accomplice, an anointer! That word was soon in common use, a resounding word, a word of terror. </note>

Everyone was on the look-out; every act could inspire suspicion. </note>

He tells us that he chose them not because they were the worst of the daily outbreaks of this sort, but because he personally had the misfortune to be an eye-witness of both of them. </note>

Some pushing, some pulling, they hustled him to the door. If they spared his life for the moment, it was only so that they could drag him in that battered state to prison, to judgement, to the torture. ‘I saw him as they dragged him along the street,’ says Ripamonti, ‘and heard no more about him afterwards. I do not think that he can have lived more than a few moments longer after I lost sight of him.’ </note>

He pointed them out to another man, and then to others as they came up. A crowd formed, observing and watching over the three men, whose clothing, hair and baggage proved them to be foreigners – and, what was worse, Frenchmen. </note>

The first word of his arrival from anyone, even a child, was enough to set bells ringing and crowds gathering. The unhappy stranger would be stoned, or dragged off to prison by the mob. </note>

The principal streets of Milan end, as they reach the outer parts of the city, in crossroads, or rather little squares, then still known by the ancient name of ‘carrobi’, which now only one of them retains. At each of them the procession halted, and the coffin was set down beside the cross which San Carlo had caused to be erected in every one of these spaces during the previous pestilence. (Some of them are still standing today.) </note>

To quote Ripamonti again: ‘While the corpses scattered or heaped up in the streets were constantly before our eyes or under our feet, making the whole city one vast charnel house, there was something yet uglier and more sinister to be seen in this mutual savagery, these unbridled and monstrous suspicions … It was not only neighbours, friends or guests who inspired these fears; for those names which are the very links of human affection, the names of husband and wife, of father and son, of brother and brother, became words of terror. Horribly and unworthy of humanity as it may seem, the family dining-table and the marriage bed were feared as ambushes, as lurking places for poison.’12 </note>

Mortales parat morbos, miranda videntur.’14 This prediction, which came, it was so said, from a book entitled ‘The Mirror of Perfect Almanacks’, printed at Turin in 1623, was quoted by everybody. </note>

If the fame of authors were proportionate to the sum of good or evil caused by their works, Delrio would be one of the most celebrated writers of all time. His literary labours cost more human lives than the military campaigns of any conqueror. His ‘Magical Disquisitions’, a summary of all the nonsensical dreams that men had entertained on this subject from the earliest times up to his own day, had become the most authoritative and incontrovertible of texts, and provided both the procedure and the motivating force for more than a century of horrifying, continuous legal slaughter. </note>

For Tadino later extracted from the same events conclusive proof that poisonous anointings and witchcraft were to blame for everything. In the case of Carlo Colonna, the second victim to die of the plague in Milan, Tadino had described delirium as a typical result of the disease, and yet later on he was capable of treating the following story as proof of anointing and of diabolical conspiracy. Two witnesses, he says, swore that a sick friend had told them that unknown visitors had come into his room one night and offered to cure him and make him rich if he would promise to anoint the neighbouring houses; but when he refused, they vanished, their places being taken by a wolf lying under the bed and three great cats on top of it, ‘which did remain there until the Break of Day’.15 </note>
