        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n2" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10023" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10100">And, to tell the truth, even I—manuscript before me and pen in hand, contending only with words and fearing only the criticism of my readers—even I feel a certain reluctance to go on. For there is something unsettling about this effortless deploying of so many fine exhortations: to fortitude and charity, to diligent caring for others and boundless self-sacrifice. </note>

It didn’t want anyone to know. It wanted secrecy, so it could be at liberty to nurture its schemes of treachery and violence. It ordered you to transgress and keep silent: You transgressed and did not speak. </note>

And me, all because of one white lie, which I told only to save my skin, I am subjected to this reproach. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n21" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10492" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10562">Then you would have known that evil might issue threats and strike blows, but it cannot command. You should have joined together, in accordance with the laws of God, what man wanted to put asunder. You should have administered to those unhappy innocents the sacrament they had every right to ask of you. God Himself would have kept you safe from the consequences, since you would have been following His path; but since you took another path, you are responsible for your own safety, and look at the consequences! </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n22" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10563" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10586">Did you have no human defenses? Did you see no way out? Did you look for one, think of one, attempt one? </note>

They were ready to escape from the tyrant’s reach and had already chosen a place of refuge. </note>

Throughout that long speech, the most vivid image to appear before him was that of the two bravi, together with the thought that Don Rodrigo was alive and well and, sooner or later, would return in glory and triumph and fury. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n28" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10724" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10776">And although the Cardinal’s dignity, demeanor, and language filled him with confusion and fear, his fear neither overwhelmed him nor ultimately persuaded him to change his ways, since, in his mind, the Cardinal wielded no musket, no sword, and no bravi. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n29" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10777" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10828">“How did you not realize,” the Cardinal continued, “that if no other refuge was available to those poor oppressed innocents, I was always there to welcome them and get them to safety if you had sent them to me, sent the forsaken to a bishop as his children, not as a share of his burden but as a precious share of his riches? </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n30" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10829" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10856">As for you, I would have been anxious for you. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep until I was certain that not a hair on your head would be harmed. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n33" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10916" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10941">Did you not realize that, while men are frequently inclined to make promises they cannot keep, by the same token they threaten far more than they actually attempt? </note>

        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n36" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11000" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11033">“But you,” the Cardinal continued and concluded, “did not see and did not want to see anything other than your own temporal danger. Small wonder, then, that it seemed so great to you that you neglected everything else for its sake.” </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n37" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11034" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11053">“It’s because I am the one who saw those faces,” Don Abbondio blurted out. “I am the one who heard their words. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n38" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11054" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11070">It’s easy for Your Grace to speak, but put yourself in the shoes of a poor priest who found himself in that spot.” </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n39" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11071" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11134">The moment he uttered these words, he bit his tongue. He realized that he’d let his irritation get the better of him, and said to himself, “Now I’ll have the devil to pay!” But as he cast a dubious look upward, he was amazed to see in that man—whose thoughts he could never guess or understand—to see, as I was saying, his stern expression of reprimand soften to something more remorseful and pensive. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n40" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11135" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11146">“Unfortunately,” said Federigo, “such is our miserable and terrifying condition. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n41" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11147" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11182">Only God knows whether we ourselves are ready to offer what we must demand rigorously from others: We must judge, correct, reprimand. And only God knows what we ourselves would have done in such an instance, what we have done in similar instances! </note>
        <note xml:id="english_2022_cap26-n42" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11183" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_11200">But I would be wrong to use my weakness as the measure of other men’s duties, as the standard for my teaching! </note>

So that, if I have failed to set an example, I can at least make a confession. </note>

Then the words I speak will carry more value, since you will hear more vividly that they do not belong to me, but rather to He who gives both you and me the strength we need to do what those words prescribe.” </note>

But how he torments not just me,” thought Don Abbondio, “but also himself. For not only must I wrack my brain, and criticize and interrogate myself, but so must he.” Then he said aloud, “Your Grace, you must be joking. </note>
