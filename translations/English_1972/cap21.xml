For it never occurred to anyone that somebody might be rash enough to use that name without permission. </note>

Nibbio put his head out, and she whispered the master’s instructions in his ear. </note>

Come with me, for I’ve orders to treat you well and cheer you up.’ </note>

They also tried, as gently as possible, to induce Lucia to do what she was told. </note>

But then she saw Nibbio scowl meaningly at the cloth in his hand, and she choked back her cry. Trembling and struggling, she was picked up and put into the litter. </note>

As she heard it at this moment, a strange, faint, confused sensation came to the unhappy creature, like the memory of light to an old man blinded in early childhood. </note>

The litter was coming up at a snail’s pace, as the carriage had done before; in front of it, and leaving it further behind every moment, came Nibbio, running up the hill. </note>

The coachman knew his job, and the horses were fine; we met no one. And yet …’ </note>

Get yourself a horse, and take one of the men with you – or two, if you like – and be off, as fast as you can, to Don Rodrigo’s place – you know Don Rodrigo. </note>

But his mind was struck again by the memory of that word ‘compassion’, coming so strangely from Nibbio. ‘However did she manage to put that into his head?’ he wondered, fascinated by the question. </note>

Far from being able to find any reasons for what he had done which might seem to provide it with an adequate excuse, he hardly knew how to explain to himself how he had brought himself to do it at all. </note>

Caught in the toils of self-examination, the unhappy man found that to explain a single action he must embark on a review of his whole life. </note>

Every detail of his actions appeared before his mind’s eye; he knew them well, yet saw them as if for the first time, in isolation from the passions that had led him to will them and to carry them out. They came back to him in their full enormity – an enormity which the passions had previously concealed. </note>

The horror of that thought, renewed by each successive remembered image, inseparable from each recollected event, drove him to despair. </note>

He seized a pistol, pulled it down and … at the very moment when he was about to put an end to a life which had become unbearable, his heart was invaded by a new fear, a new disquiet which could almost be called posthumous; for he now cast his mind forwards into the future – that time which would ineluctably continue to flow on after his death. </note>

He felt that he would not have hesitated like that in broad daylight, out in the open before a crowd. He could have thrown himself into a river, for example, and disappeared for ever. </note>

But if so, what am I doing? Why should I cut my life short? What does it matter what I’ve done, what does it matter? In that case it’s crazy to think of putting an end to myself! </note>

Calmer now, he lowered his hands from his temples, and fixed his inward gaze on the girl from whom he had heard those words.

What shall I do the day after, and the day after that? </note>

At other times he felt a baleful hope that he might recover his old fiery spirit and his ancient purpose, that all this might prove to be a passing aberration. Now he feared the dawn, which must show him to his men in such a lamentably altered state; now he longed for it, as if it might bring light to his heart as well as to his eyes. </note>

But as the light grew steadily brighter, he could make out crowds of people moving along the road at the bottom of the valley, some emerging from the houses, but others coming from farther afield. They were all flocking in the same direction, to the right of the castle, towards the exit of the valley. They were all wearing their Sunday clothes, and walking very briskly. </note>
