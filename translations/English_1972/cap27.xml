        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n1" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10001" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10048">The war that was raging over the succession to the states of the late Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, the second of that name, is a subject that we have already had occasion to mention more than once, but always at moments when we were preoccupied with other matters, so that we have only touched on it in passing. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n2" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10049" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10062">But rather more detailed knowledge of the subject is now necessary for the proper understanding of our story. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n3" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10063" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10108">These are things which are doubtless familiar to readers of history. But as a proper sense of our own quality leads us to think that our present book will only be read by the unlearned, perhaps we had better provide enough information to satisfy those who may need it. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n4" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10109" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10162">We mentioned that, when Vincenzo Gonzaga died, the first Candidate for the succession was Carlo Gonzaga, the head of a cadet branch of the family, which had moved to France, where he held the duchies of Nevers and Rhétel; and that Carlo Gonzaga had taken possession of Mantua. We must now add that he had also occupied Montferrat – a point which we left out last time in our haste. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n5" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10163" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10231">The court of Madrid wanted to get the new prince out of those two states at all costs, as we also mentioned. But it needed a good reason for getting him out of them, because a war made without good reason would be an unjust war. So it declared its support for the claim to Mantua of another Gonzaga, namely Ferrante, Prince of Guastalla, and for the claims to Montferrat of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, and of Margherita Gonzaga, the Dowager Duchess of Lorraine. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n6" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10232" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10325">Now Don Gonzalo was of the same family, and bore the same name, as the Great Captain. He had already fought a war in Flanders, and he was very anxious to fight another in Italy. He probably did more than anybody to get this one under way. In the meanwhile, interpreting the intentions and anticipating the orders of Madrid, he had concluded a treaty with the Duke of Savoy for the invasion and partition of Montferrat. He got the Count – Duke to ratify the treaty without difficulty, by persuading him that it would be quite easy to get control of Casale, which was the best-defended point in the zone reserved for the King of Spain. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n7" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10326" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10390">But Don Gonzalo protested in His Majesty’s name that he had no wish to occupy any territory, except to hold it in trust until the Emperor had given his ruling in the matter. Partly because of outside influence, however, and partly for his own reasons, the Emperor had meanwhile refused to sanction the investiture of the new duke, and told him to leave the disputed states in imperial hands for the moment; he himself would hear both sides, and hand the states over to the rightful owner when he had done so. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n8" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10391" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10399">This was something that the Duke of Nevers would not accept. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n9" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10400" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10420">The duke also had powerful friends on his side – Cardinal Richelieu, the senators of Venice, and the Pope (who was then Urban VIII, as we mentioned before). </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n10" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10421" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10458">But Richelieu was then busy with the siege of La Rochelle and with a war against England, and was opposed by the party of the Queen Mother, Marie de’ Medici, who had her own reasons for disliking the House of Nevers; so that he could contribute nothing but promises. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n11" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10459" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10506">The Venetians would not move, nor even declare their support, until a French army arrived in Italy. They helped the duke secretly, as well as they could, making representations of various kinds – protests, suggestions, peaceful or threatening exhortations, according to circumstances – to the Court of Madrid and the Governor of Milan. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n12" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10507" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10533">The Pope recommended Nevers to his friends, interceded on his behalf with his enemies, and put forward proposals of compromise. But he would not hear of putting any troops in the field. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n13" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10534" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10546">So the two aggressive allies could begin their campaign in safety. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n14" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10547" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10585">The Duke of Savoy, for his part, had entered the territory of Montferrat. Don Gonzalo had enthusiastically formed the siege of Casale; but he did not find the operation as satisfactory as he had imagined; for it must not be thought that war is a bed of roses. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n15" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10586" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10622">The Court did not give him the support he wanted; in fact it left him short of the most basic necessities. His ally gave him more help than he cared for. For the Duke of Savoy not only took his own portion, but began to encroach on that allotted to the King of Spain. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n16" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10623" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10669">Don Gonzalo was furious; but the Duke of Savoy was just as distinguished for skill in negotiation and for changeability in the matter of alliances as for bravery on the field of battle; and Don Gonzalo was afraid that if he made any fuss his ally would call in the French. So he had to shut his eyes to what was going on, swallow his wrath, and say nothing. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n17" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10670" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10705">Meanwhile his siege was going badly. It was taking too long, and from time to time the besiegers were driven back; both because the defenders were brave, vigilant and determined, and because Don Gonzalo had too few troops. Some historians say that he also made a lot of mistakes. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n18" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10706" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10754">We will not claim to know the truth of this matter; but if it were really so, we would be inclined to regard it as a very good thing, provided that it led to a smaller number of soldiers being killed, mutilated or crippled in that siege – or even, other things being equal, if it merely led to slightly less damage being done to the tiled roofs of Casale. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n19" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10755" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10769">While Don Gonzalo was in these difficulties, he received the news of the riots in Milan, and hastily returned there in person. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n20" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10770" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10813">Among the things reported to him on arrival were the rebellious and noisy escape of Renzo, and the real and imaginary events that had caused his arrest. Don Gonzalo was also told that he had taken refuge in the territory of Bergamo. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n21" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10814" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10820">This point attracted the Governor’s attention. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n22" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10821" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10884">He knew from other sources that the Venetians had been much encouraged by the riots at Milan; that they had at one time believed that he would have to raise the siege of Casale as a result; and that they still thought he must be bewildered and worried – all the more, because of a second piece of news, welcome to Venice but dreaded by Don Gonzalo, which followed soon after the riots: La Rochelle had surrendered. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n23" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10885" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10930">Very indignant, both as a man and as a politician, that the Venetians should have such an opinion of him, he was on the lookout for any opportunity of giving them proof, by implication, that he had lost nothing of his previous confidence. (By implication, because to say explicitly, ‘I’m not afraid!’ is quite meaningless.) </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n24" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_10931" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11016">A good way of furnishing such proof is to show bad temper, to quarrel and to make demands. And so one day, when the Resident of Venice came to see the Governor, to pay his respects and also to judge from his expression and behaviour the state of his inner feelings – this is all worth noting, as an example of the old subtle diplomacy – Don Gonzalo first of all touched lightly on the riots, speaking like a man who has already taken all the necessary steps; but then he went on to make a considerable issue, as you have already heard, of the story of Renzo. The result is also known to you. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n25" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11017" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11106">Afterwards he did not concern himself any further with an affair of so little weight, which was all over, as far as he was concerned. When the reply reached him, a good deal later on, he was back in camp before Casale, with his mind on other things. He lifted his head and gazed around him, like a silkworm looking for a mulberry leaf; he stood still for a moment, trying to bring his shadowy memory of the facts back to life. He recalled the episode, and a confused idea of the man concerned passed through his mind; then he went on to something else, and thought no more about it. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n26" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11107" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11143">From the little that Renzo had been able to put together, he had no reason to expect anything like that benevolent indifference – quite the contrary. For some time he had no thought or care for anything but preserving his incognito. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n27" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11144" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11163">It can be imagined how impatient he was to send news of himself to Lucia and Agnese, and to hear news of them; but there were serious difficulties here. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n28" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11164" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11234">One was that it meant trusting his secret to a letter writer; for the poor fellow could not write. He could not even read, in the full sense of the word. The reader may recall that when Dr Quibbler asked him if he could read, he replied that he could. That was not from any wish to boast, or to show off; he could read printed material, given time; but handwriting is another matter. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n29" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11235" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11286">So he had to tell a third party about his affairs, about that vital secret. It was not so easy to find a man who could both wield a pen and keep a confidence in those days; especially in a place where there was no one whom Renzo had known for any length of time. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n30" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11287" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11324">The second difficulty was to find a messenger – a man who was going to the right place, would agree to take the job on, and would really carry it out – another set of virtues that could not easily be found in a single person. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n31" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11325" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11333">Finally, after much searching, he found someone to write the letter. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n32" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11334" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11360">But as he did not know whether the women were still at Monza, or where else they might be, he thought it best to enclose the letter for Agnese in another addressed to Father Cristoforo. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n33" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11361" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11414">The letter-writer took on the job of arranging delivery as well. He gave the envelope to a traveller whose journey took him near to Pescarenico. The man left it with an inn-keeper, as near as possible to its destination, asking him most earnestly to forward it. As the letter was addressed to a monastery, it was in fact delivered there, but what happened to it after that has never been discovered. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n34" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11415" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11444">As Renzo received no reply, he had another letter written, in much the same terms as the first, and enclosed it in a message to some friend or relation of his at Lecco. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n35" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11445" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11460">Another messenger was sought and found, and this time the letter reached its destination. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n36" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11461" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11508">Agnese hurried to Maggianico and got her cousin Alessio to read it and explain it to her. With his help, she concocted a reply, which he wrote out for her. Then they found a way of sending it to Antonio Rivolta at his place of residence – though not as quickly as this brief account might suggest. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n37" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11509" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11515">Renzo received the letter, and had another written in reply. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n38" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11516" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11536">In fact a correspondence began between the two sides. It was neither swift nor regular, it proceeded by fits and starts, with long gaps; but it went forward none the less. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n39" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11537" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11568">To have an idea of what this correspondence was like, we need to know how that sort of business was transacted in those days – or rather how it is still transacted today, for we doubt if there has been much change. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n40" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11569" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11627">The peasant who cannot write, and needs something written, turns to someone who has learned to use a pen. He chooses him, as far as he can, among those of his own class; for he is either shy of approaching others, or does not trust them sufficiently. He tells the man what has gone before, with such clarity and logical order as he can muster, and then tells him, in the same style, what he wants to say. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n41" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11628" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11708">The literate friend understands part of what he says, and misunderstands another part; he advises him, suggests a couple of changes, and then says ‘Leave it to me!’ He takes up his pen, and puts the first man’s thoughts in literary form, as best he can; corrects them or improves them, adds emphasis or takes it away, even leaves bits out, as seems best to him. For there’s no getting away from it – a man who knows more than his neighbours does not care to be a passive tool in their hands, and once he has become involved in their affairs, wants to give them a little guidance. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n42" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11709" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11741">Moreover the literate friend may not always succeed in saying what he means. Sometimes he says something quite different. (We professional writers of books have been known to do the same.) </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n43" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11742" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11774">When such a letter reaches the other correspondent, who is equally ignorant of his ABC, he takes it to another learned man, of the same calibre, who reads it and explains it to him. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n44" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11775" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11811">Then doubts arise over what the letter really means. The interested party, with his knowledge of what has gone before, maintains that certain words must mean one thing; but the man who is doing the reading, from his knowledge of the written language, claims that they must mean something else. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n45" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11812" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11844">In the end the man who cannot write must put himself in the hands of the man who can, and must charge him with the task of replying. The answer will be composed in the same fashion as the first letter, and will be submitted to the same sort of interpretation. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n46" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11845" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_11934">But if the subject of the correspondence happens to be a little delicate; if private matters are involved, which must not be intelligible to a stranger, in case the letter should go astray; if, for those reasons, there is a deliberate attempt not to put things too clearly … why, then the correspondence cannot go on for very long before the two sides are at the same stage of mutual understanding as two medieval scholars might once have been after four hours of argument about the entelechy. (We have not taken a more modern example, for fear of getting a rap over the knuckles.) </note>

Secret warnings, false names, the idea of being in no danger but having to remain in hiding were all unfamiliar concepts to the readers, and expressed in veiled terms in the letter. </note>

Her blind and violent hatred against him strengthened the girl’s feelings of pity.

He could explain how the salamander can stay in the fire without getting burnt; how that little fish the remora has the strength and the cunning to bring a great ship under full sail to a sudden halt; how dew-drops turn into pearls within the shell of a mollusc; how the chameleon feeds on air; how rock crystal is formed from ice, as it slowly hardens over the centuries; and many other wonderful secrets of nature. </note>

There Bodino, Cavalcanti, Sansovino, Paruta, and Boccalini stood out among many other books of less bulk and secondary importance. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n112" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_14587" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_14664">But there were two volumes which he esteemed far above all others in this branch; two volumes that he had long put jointly in the first place, without being able to decide which of them deserved to have it for his own. One contained the Prince and the Discourses of the Florentine Secretary1 – a blackguard, of course, said Don Ferrante, but a deep thinker for all that. The other contained the Ragion di stato of the equally celebrated Giovanni Botero – a decent fellow, of course, Don Ferrante would add, but keen-witted for all that. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n113" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_14665" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_14883">But just a short while before the time of our story, a book had appeared which settled the question of primacy for ever, for it excelled the works of even those two matadors, to use Don Ferrante’s own words. This was a book which contained every kind of cunning trick in distilled form, so that you could easily recognize them, and also all the virtues, so that you could practise them. It was a short book, but of pure gold; in a word, it was the Statista regnante of Don Valeriano Castiglione, that most famous man, of whom it could be said that the great scholars vied with one another in his praise, and the greatest statesmen vied with each other for his services. Pope Urban VIII honoured him with a magnificent panegyric, as is well known. Cardinal Borghese tried to persuade him to describe the deeds of Pope Paul V, and Don Pedro of Toledo, the Viceroy of Naples, urged him to write of the Italian wars of His Catholic Majesty – and both in vain. King Louis XIII of France, at the suggestion of Cardinal Richelieu, appointed him his historiographer, and the Duke Charles Emmanuel of Savoy gave him the same honour. Not to prolong this list of splendid recommendations, let us end by saying that the Duchess Christine of Savoy, the daughter of the Most Christian King Henry IV, granted him a diploma in which, among many other distinctions, she felt able to include ‘the certain glory of the fame he has won in Italy of being the greatest writer of our day’. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n115" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_14911" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_14928">Not only did he speak of this subject with perfect knowledge, but he was often asked to intervene in questions of honour, and was never at a loss to give a verdict. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n116" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_14929" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_15012">He had the works of the most highly esteemed authors in this branch of learning in his library, and, we may add, in his head. He had Paride dal Pozzo, Fausto da Longiano, Urrea, Muzio, Romei and Albergato, together with the first Forno and the second Forno of Torquato Tasso. He also had the last author’s Gerusalemme liberata and Gerusalemme conquistata always by him, and could quote from memory, if necessary, all the passages they contained which had a bearing on questions of chivalry. </note>

For his part the author always spoke of Don Ferrante with particular esteem. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n118" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_15056" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_15106">From the moment that this distinguished writer’s Discorsi cavallereschi were published, Don Ferrante prophesied without any hesitation that the new work would destroy the prestige formerly enjoyed by Olevano, and would remain, together with the other noble issue of the same pen, as a code of ultimate authority for future generations. Anyone can see how fully that forecast has been proved true, adds our anonymous author, who goes on to discuss the works of pure literature on Don Ferrante’s shelves. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap27-n119" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_15107" targetEnd="quarantana/cap27.xml#c27_15254">But we are beginning to doubt whether the reader really wants to accompany him on this further review of the library. In fact we begin to wonder whether we have not already won the title of servile copyist for ourselves, and a half share of the title of long-winded bore which belongs to our afore-mentioned anonymous friend. For we have naively followed him into matters which are remote from the main thread of our story, and which he probably treated at such length only to show off his own learning and to demonstrate that there was nothing out of date about his views … We will leave in as much as we have already written, so as not to waste the work we have put into it, but we will omit what follows, and get back on to the main road again – all the more so because we have a good, way to travel before we meet any of our characters again, and a still longer way to go before we find them engaged in the matters that must surely interest the reader most, if indeed he is interested at all in what we have to say. </note>

Nothing happened to any of them, and nothing could be done by any of them, which is worth reporting. </note>

But an event of great public importance swept their plans away and this indeed was one of the least of its effects. </note>
