He was waiting very anxiously to hear what the end of the day’s disturbances would be; but he was far from suspecting that it would fall so catastrophically on his own head. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n2" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10046" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10059">A good citizen ran on ahead of the mob to warn him what was coming. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n4" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10080" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10115">While they listened to the messenger, the vanguard of the mob came into sight. They quickly took the message in to their master. He decided on flight, and was thinking how to get away, when a second messenger arrived to say that it was already too late. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n5" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10116" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10127">The servants hardly had time to shut the door, which they rapidly bolted and barred. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n7" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10155" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10189">The howling outside grew louder and louder. In the courtyard it seemed to be coming down from the sky, like the sound of thunder; and every room and hollow space in the building resounded with it. Amid the vast, confused clamour could be heard the loud, rapid impact of heavy stones against the door. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n13" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10231" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10235">But how could it be done, and where could he go? </note>

He heard many voices calling for his death, and withdrew, more bewildered than ever, to look for the safest and most secluded hiding-place in the house. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n15" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10278" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10323">He cowered there, and listened feverishly for some sign of reduction in the volume of that ill-omened uproar. But then he heard the clamour grow louder and fiercer than ever, while the battering on the door redoubled. Overcome by the thumping of his own heart, he put his fingers in his ears. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n16" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10324" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10369">Then, as if out of his mind, he gritted his teeth, screwed up his face, and stretched out his arms in front of him, pushing, pushing, with the actions of a man trying to hold a door shut … But we cannot be sure exactly what he did next; for he was alone, and history can only guess at the details. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n17" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10370" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10373">Fortunately she has had plenty of practice … </note>

He had not been carried there by the movement of the crowd, but had thrust his way into the centre of things deliberately. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n19" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10391" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10428">He had felt a thrill of revulsion at the first cry for blood. As regards breaking into the house and ransacking it, he could hardly have said whether that was right or wrong in the circumstances; but the idea of murder inspired him with an immediate feeling of unmixed horror. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n20" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10429" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10502">Passionate natures are all too ready to accept the passionate assertions of a crowd, and Renzo was utterly convinced that the commissioner was the main cause of the famine and the enemy of the people. And yet … and yet … as the crowd moved off towards the commissioner’s house, Renzo happened to overhear someone saying that he would do anything to save the unfortunate man, and at once decided to do what he could to help. With that object he had pushed his way through the throng almost up to the door, which was suffering many different kinds of assault at once. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n21" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10503" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10556">Some people were banging away with large stones at the nails which held the lock in position, hoping to work it loose. Others were using heavy poles, hammers and chisels in a more regular attack. Others again were using broken knives, pieces of stone, iron nails, sticks or their bare fingers if they had nothing else, scraping and picking at the wall, trying to loosen the bricks and make a breach. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n22" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10557" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10612">Those who could do nothing to help encouraged the others with loud cries; but at the same time they kept thronging in towards the wall and getting in the way of the workers, who were already getting in each other’s way as they vied with one another in their uncoordinated enthusiasm. This is a thing we often see in good works – that the most ardent participants become a hindrance to the others – but mercifully it sometimes happens in bad works too. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n23" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10613" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10643">As soon as the magistrates heard what was happening, they at once sent for help to the commander of the fortress, which was then known as the Castello di Porta Giovia; and he did send some troops. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n24" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10644" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10679">But by the time the message had been delivered, the orders given, the soldiers formed up and given the word to move off and marched to their destination, the house was already surrounded by a vast mob. The detachment halted on the edge of the crowd, at quite a distance from the door. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n25" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10680" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10688">The officer in charge did not know what to do next. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n27" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10709" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10729">When they were told to move on, or to make way, their only response was a long, ugly, rumbling sound; not one of them budged an inch. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n28" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10730" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10763">To open fire on this mass of people seemed to the officer to be not only inhumane, but also highly dangerous; for it would have hurt only the least vicious elements in the crowd, and roused its more violent members to a frenzy. Besides he had no instructions to use fire-arms. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n29" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10764" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10794">To open a way through that outer throng, pushing them back on either side as his men went in, and to go forward to attack the aggressive elements in the centre, would be the best plan; but how could he bring it off? </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n30" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10795" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10828">As the soldiers moved in, would they be able to keep together, in proper formation?… If, instead of breaking up the crowd, they were themselves split up in the middle of the throng, they would be at the mercy of the rioters, after having roused them to wrath. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n31" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10829" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10842">Rightly or wrongly the hesitation of the officer and the immobility of the troops were attributed to fear. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n32" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10843" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10914">The people nearest them merely stared them in the face, as much as to say: we don’t give a damn for you. Those who were a little further into the crowd defied them with grimaces and derisive shouts. Further in still, few members of the mob either knew or cared that they were there. The men who were demolishing the wall went on with their work, without any other concern than its speedy completion, and the spectators continued to urge them on with shouts of encouragement. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n33" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10915" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10977">Among the spectators was one – a debauched looking old man – who was a spectacle in himself. With his deep-set, bloodshot eyes stretched as wide open as they would go, with the wrinkles of his face distorted into a smirk of fiendish pleasure, with hands held high above his unreverend white locks, he was brandishing a hammer, a rope and four large nails. When the commissioner had been killed, he said, these things would be used to hang his body up on the front door of his own house. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n34" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_10978" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_11014">‘For shame!’ cried Renzo. He was horrified by the old man’s words, and by the faces of many bystanders who seemed to approve them; but at the same time he was encouraged by others he saw who looked as deeply shocked as himself, though they were keeping quiet about it. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n35" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_11015" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_11015">‘For shame! </note>

You traitor to your country!’ cried a bystander who had managed to hear this praiseworthy speech among the general din, turning a face contorted with devilish passion towards Renzo. </note>

He would gladly have vanished altogether. One or two of his neighbours gathered round him protectively, and shouted other slogans as loudly as they could to confuse and drown the voices of those who were crying for blood. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap13-n45" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_11144" targetEnd="quarantana/cap13.xml#c13_11167">But what really saved him was a great cry of ‘Make way! Make way!’ which suddenly rang out close at hand. ‘Make way! Here it comes! This is what we want! Make way!’ </note>

One man had his head between two rungs, and the supports on his shoulders; he was weighed down and shaken from side to side as if beneath a yoke, and was roaring with pain. Another was pushed right away from the ladder by a movement of the crowd. The end he had dropped cracked against the backs, arms and ribs of the bystanders, whose comments can be imagined. </note>

He took advantage of the local confusion which was now superimposed on the general one, and made off. He covered the first few yards bent almost double, as unobtrusively as possible, and then made free use of his elbows to get away from a spot which was clearly unhealthy for him. He decided to get right out of the mob as soon as he could, and really go back to the monastery this time to find Father Bonaventura, or wait for him if necessary. </note>

He had come to make good use of the fund of goodwill that he had acquired by doubtful means. </note>
