Griso followed him and immediately delivered his report of what he had arranged, done, seen and not seen, heard, feared, and fixed.

And finally, Griso himself was to go, along with a couple of his most calm and levelheaded men, to mingle with the people and try to dig up information about the havoc of that night. </note>

And then to be welcomed back like that! No good deed goes unpunished. </note>
