They also reminded him that, by an uninterrupted succession of laws and by a special decree of Charles V., the expenses of the plague should be defrayed by the government. During the plague of 1576, the Governor, the Marquis d'Ayamonte, not only suspended all taxes, but presented the city with a subsidy of forty thousand scudi; and, finally, these deputies should demand four things from the Governor: that taxation should be suspended, as upon the former occasion; that the government should provide necessary funds; that he, the Governor, should inform the King of the misery endured both by the city and province; and that he should henceforth quarter no more soldiers in the country, already desolated by military lawlessness. </note>

The case was then placed near the little cross which had been raised in each square by San Carlo, during the previous plague; some of these crosses are yet standing. The procession, proceeding after this manner, returned to the Cathedral a little after mid-day. </note>

Within, attended by a numerous suite, sat a personage of a noble and majestic carriage, but whose complexion was dark and bronzed, whose eyes were inflamed, whose hair stood an end, whose lips were contracted and menacing. </note>

After a short time the equipage paused, and they dismounted at the gates of a certain palace. The citizen entered with his companions, and saw mingled scenes of delight and horror, frightful deserts and joyous gardens, gloomy caverns and magnificent saloons. Phantoms were here assembled in council. </note>

Curious is it indeed to find this man, who in the case of Carlo Colonna, the second individual who fell a victim to the plague, had remarked his delirium as an effect of the disease, adducing, in proof of the anointings and of the whole diabolical plot, the following fact: that two witnesses deposed that they had heard a sick friend of theirs relate how one night people had entered his room and offered him his recovery and money, if he would only anoint the houses in the neighbourhood; and how, upon his refusal, these persons had gone away, and there remained in their stead a wolf under the bed and three big cats upon it; 'where they remained until the dawn of day,' remarks our author. </note>
