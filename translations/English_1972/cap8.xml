He must have been a learned man, one of the great scholars of antiquity; one of those ancient names; but who was he?’ – such was the distance the poor fellow was from foreseeing the storm which was gathering over his head! </note>

A neighbouring priest, who had a small library, lent him one book after another, generally giving him the first volume that came to hand. </note>

Sad and preoccupied, they go on into the bustling towns. The houses huddled against each other, the streets that lead only into other streets, have a suffocating effect. They stand in front of buildings admired by foreigners, and think, with uneasy longing, of the little plot of land near their own village, the cottage on which they have so long had their eye, and which they intend to buy when they make their prosperous return to their beloved mountains. </note>
