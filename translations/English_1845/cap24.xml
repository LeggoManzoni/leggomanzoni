Lucia, who but a short time before had desired this, and who having no other hope in the world, had only desired to see him; now, after having seen friendly faces and heard friendly voices, could not repress a sudden terror; she shuddered, held her breath, and pressing close to the good woman, concealed her face in her bosom. </note>
