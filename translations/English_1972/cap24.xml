Next he called the old servant out, and sent in Don Abbondio with the good woman from the village. </note>

He sent the old servant away to a distant part of the castle – he had already sent off the other woman who had been on guard in the next room. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n19" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10244" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10280">The noise in the outer room, the moment of waiting that followed it, the first appearance of an unknown figure, all combined to throw Lucia into a fever of anxiety: for though her present situation was an intolerable one, any change in it still aroused renewed suspicion and fresh terrors in her heart. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n20" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10281" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10298">She looked at the newcomers, and saw a priest, and a woman, which cheered her a little; then she looked again more carefully. ‘Can it be him? It can’t!’ she thought. But it was. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n21" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10299" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10309">She recognized Don Abbondio, and sat there with her eyes fixed, as if spellbound. </note>

Come with us!’ </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n23" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10341" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10381">‘Who are you?’ demanded Lucia. But then, without waiting for an answer, she turned to Don Abbondio, who was standing two paces away, also with a compassionate look on his face. She stared at him again and cried, ‘You? Can it really be you, your Reverence? </note>

She straightened up quickly, stared again at her two visitors, and said, ‘Then it must be the Madonna that has sent you!’ </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n30" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10449" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10456">‘I think you’re right!’ said the woman. </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n32" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10477" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10495">‘What about all those men?’ she went on, her lips tight and trembling with fear and horror. ‘What about their master? That fearful man? </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n33" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10496" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10499">Though it was he who gave me the promise …’ </note>

A little before Lucia had been anxious to see him – in fact, since she had had no hope in anyone else in the world, there had been no one else that she wanted to see. But now, after a few moments of seeing friendly faces and hearing friendly voices, she could not suppress a momentary revulsion at the sight of him. She quivered, held her breath, clasped the woman tightly in her arms, and hid her face against that comforting bosom. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n37" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10590" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10657">The Unnamed had halted just inside the door, on catching sight of Lucia’s face, at which he had been unable to look steadily even the night before and which now was still more pale, distressed and exhausted by hours of misery and hunger. When he saw her instinctive movement of terror, he lowered his eyes, and remained for a moment silent and motionless. Then he spoke in reply to the reproach which the poor girl had not uttered, ‘You are right, you are right!’ he cried. ‘Forgive me!’ </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n38" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10658" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10679">‘He’s come to set you free; he’s not like the same man any more; he’s good now. Don’t you hear him asking you to forgive him?’ whispered the woman to Lucia. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n39" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10680" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10684">‘What more is there that he could say? </note>

        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n41" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10701" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10732">Lucia raised her eyes and saw the Unnamed’s head bowed low, his eyes looking embarrassedly at the floor. A mixed feeling of comfort, gratitude and pity overcame her, and she said: ‘Oh my dear lord! </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n42" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10733" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10739">God reward you for the mercy you have shown towards me!’ </note>

With a gentle, almost shy consideration which was quite new to him, he opened its door and helped Lucia in, supporting her arm; and then he did the same for her companion. </note>
        <note xml:id="english_1972_cap24-n48" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10823" targetEnd="quarantana/cap24.xml#c24_10835">Next he untied Don Abbondio’s mule, and helped him up on to her back. </note>

If they had often mocked at those ideas, it was not because they did not believe in them, but because mockery was a sort of shield against the terror that would have seized them if they had thought seriously about the subject. </note>

Those who had witnessed these things had also spoken of them after their return to the castle. </note>

He still stood apart from the common herd, was still their chief. </note>

Some took no decision except to promise whatever might be asked of them and to stay on for a while, eating the bread which was so generously offered to them and which was so scarce elsewhere; and thus to gain a little time. No one spoke. </note>

There was a certain sweetness in that return to a habit dating from the time of his innocence; a quickening of pain at the thought of the abyss which lay between that time and the present; a yearning for the day when works of expiation would win him a better conscience, a state as close as possible to the innocence he could never regain; a feeling of gratitude and of trust in that mercy which alone could lead him to that state, and which had already given him so many indications that such was its will. </note>

And yet, if his work had been lost, we would know nothing about them – none of the details at least. For Ripamonti and Rivola, whom we have already quoted, merely say that that famous tyrant had a meeting with Federigo Borromeo, after which he underwent an astonishing and permanent change of heart. </note>
