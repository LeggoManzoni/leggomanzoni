We find an extraordinary something in thus, with so little fatigue, bringing into the field so many beautiful precepts of fortitude and of love, of active eagerness for others, of unlimited sacrifice of self. </note>

"This also has been reported by the tattling women," thought Don Abbondio; but he gave no sign that he had anything to say; and the Cardinal resumed—"If it is true that you have told these poor young people that which was not the truth, so as to keep them in ignorance, in obscurity, as this wicked man desired — then I must believe it; then there only remains for me to blush with you for your conduct, and to hope that you will weep with me over it. </note>

"This is the way of the world," again said Don Abbondio to himself; "for this very Satan," here he thought of the Unknown, "he had embraces; and for me, for a half lie, told only to save my life, there is all this uproar. </note>

Aloud he said, "I have done wrong, I know that I have done wrong; but what ought I to have done in a misfortune of this kind?" </note>

God would have remained responsible for the consequences, for His commands would have been obeyed; but you have obeyed other commands, and it is you who will be responsible for the consequences—and what consequences! </note>
          <note xml:id="English_1845_cap26-n20" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10563" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10586">But how did you know that all human means failed you, that no way of escape was open to you, when you scarcely looked around you, scarcely thought or sought after it? </note>

"Perpetua's advice!" thought Don Abbondio, full of anger; in whose mind, in the midst of all these discourses, was most livingly impressed the image of these bravoes, and the thought that Don Rodrigo was alive and well, and would one day or other return glorious, triumphant, and enraged. </note>

          <note xml:id="English_1845_cap26-n30" type="comm" target="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10916" targetEnd="quarantana/cap26.xml#c26_10941">Do you not know that, if a man promises often more than he is able to do, he also does not unfrequently threaten more than he dare afterwards perform? </note>

"Precisely the reasoning of Perpetua," thought Don Abbondio again, without reflecting that this agreement of his servant and Federigo Borromeo, in their judgment regarding what he ought and could have done, was a very great argument against him. </note>

How could it appear to you important enough for you to neglect for it every thing else?" </note>

But timidly raising his eyes, he was quite astonished to see this man, whom he had never been able to understand, change from his former air of severe and imperious gravity, to a gravity full of sorrow and tenderness. </note>
        </p>
        <p n="13">

"O what a holy man! but what a torment!" thought Don Abbondio again to himself; "he has also weaknesses; he wishes that I should examine, criticise, accuse even him!" He then said aloud, "O my lord, do you joke? </note>
